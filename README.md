# Tickr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dighan/tickr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dighan/tickr)

No dependencies, tiny (`<2kB`) and customizable JavaScript library to execute code repeatedly with fixed or dynamic delay.

**Tickr** is subject to the [background browser mechanism](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/03/background_tabs) and
cannot guarantee the `delay` is always honoured between ticks.

```

or include it with a [`<script>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) tag:
