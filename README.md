# Tickr

No dependency and tiny (`<1kB`) JavaScript library to execute code repeatedly with a fixed or dynamic delay.

**NOTE:** Tickr is subject to the [background browser mechanism](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/03/background_tabs) and
cannot guarantee the `delay` is always honoured between ticks.

## Installation

Install the stable version with [`npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm):

```shell
npm install dighan@tickr --save-dev
```

Or include it with a [`<script>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script):

```html
<script src="" async></script>
```
