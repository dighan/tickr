# Tickr

No dependency and tiny (`<1kB`) JavaScript library to execute code repeatedly with a fixed or dynamic delay.

*NOTE:* Tickr is subject to the [background browser mechanism](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/03/background_tabs) and
cannot guarantee the `delay` is always honoured between ticks.
